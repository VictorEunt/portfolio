      <h3>Audience-Analysis</h3>
      <h6>The Clients and End-users</h6>
      <p>My goal was to learn about the needs of the clients of techCorp, a team of technical communication professors who wanted to develop an online corpus of technical documents produced by students. To ensure the database would meet the needs of the clients and users, I inquired about the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How long will the system exist?</li>
        <li>What type of data may develop over time?</li>
        <li>What type of information will be entered?</li>
        <li>What type of people will interact with the database?</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>The Analysis</h6>
      <p>I learned the professors had collected over 600 documents and stored descriptions for each document in an Excel sheet. The data included characteristics about the student, professor, the class, and the document itself.</p>
      <p>The users of the database would be students in higher education, researchers, and instructors. The group of users would be familiar with a research model similar to a library database. After choosing my tools, I would be ready to start the first iteration of the database.</p>
