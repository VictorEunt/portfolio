      <h2>Overture Marketplace, a Usability Study, 2016</h2>
      <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> With an unacceptable bounce rate, the student loan comparison site, Overture Marketplace sought insight into why potential customers would not engage with their online service.</p>
      <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Understanding how potential customers approach the loan comparison site, I collaborated with a small team to conduct user research and to develop, process, and analyze data by utilizing UX practices and the software UserZoom.</p><br>

        <h5>My Approach</h5>
        <p>With a team of graduate students, I advocated that we had to empathize with the customer journey: their needs, motivations, and goals that occur before, during, and after their visit to the site.</p>
        <p>My thinking was that the customer had expectations about what they would gain from the student loan comparison site that were not currently met by the Overture interface.</p>

      <h3>Understanding the Journey</h3>
      <p>Most of the participants, 5 of 6 would "checkout" Overture if a friend or parent recommended it. If in need of a student loan, the participants found a site that compared loans for free as "useful" and "smart." And if they had to share personal information, they would expect to see messages or icons that promised "security" or "encryption."</p>
      <p>To better understand the interview data, we created 2 personas to inform our usability testing.</p>

      <h3>The Story of Our Customer</h3>
      <p>I developed a brief storyboard to focus in on the Overture experience. The storyboard and personas would inform the rest of our usability testing by offering insight into our heuristic evaluations and user-tested scenarios. Throughout our usability testing, it was important to prioritize both the collected data and the customer journey.</p>

      <h3>Content Usability and Design</h3>
      <h6>Participant feedback and the Heuristic Evaluation</h6>
      <p>Every interaction tells a story, and heuristic evaluations give insight to that story. Using the goals and motivations of our personas such as Issac, the team conducted 6 expert evaluations, and I synthesized the evaluations into a heuristic evaluation. Using an affinity diagram, I would key in on the main usability issues discovered by the team.</p>

      <h6>Synthesizing the Data</h6>
      <p>The synthesis of the data gave us high-priority issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The structure of the content such as layout and navigation, and</li>
        <li>The labelling of content such as menu links.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As Overture was concerned with their high bounce rate, it was becoming evident that the structure and wording of content played a role in customer engagement. The current structure of the website would create a hindrance for our personas and potential customers, but also, the labelling of content would be an obstacle for the customer, who ideally would engage with the site with ease, trust, and passion.</p>

        <p>With feedback from our interviews, direction from our personas, and over 40 usability issues from the heuristic evaluation, I was ready to develop scenarios or tasks for our user testing. We established the following criteria for our testing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To replicate the navigation paths of the ideal customer journey,</li>
        <li>To test the dialogue and usability of the customer's loan form,</li>

      <h6>Keying in on the Customer Experience</h6>
      <p>With 3 scenarios and a survey, 37 participants tested the Overture site. All the scenarios or tasks were recorded with the UserZoom software.

      <h3>The Assessment</h3>
      <p>Not only did our participants provide the team with data to back up our heuristic evaluation, but they provided us with personal feedback that led us to the major assessments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A redesign would need a first impression and features that could build trust with customers, and</li>
        <li>Changes in structure and navigation would help customers accomplish their tasks with speed and efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Our Recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add an About Us and a Contact Section to the homepage,</li>
        <li>Make sure users can orient themselves within the site,</li>
        <li>Simplify the process for comparing loans</li>
        <li>Use consistency in the layout design, and</li>
        <li>Build credibility with user testimonials and endorsements from trustworthy organizations.</li>
