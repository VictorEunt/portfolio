      <h3>Interviews and Synthesis</h3>
      <h6>Taking Notes at a Medical Conference: It's difficult if you can't find the room.</h6>
      <p>The American Heart Association (AHA) maintains an intranet site for journalists covering the AHA conference, Scientific Sessions. Quick access to resources is essential.</p> 
      <h4>With late-breaking news releases, media briefings, and tightly scheduled interviews, medical conferences create time constraints for journalists.</h4>
      <p>With AHA requesting a review of the site, the 6 member usability team found participants from the medical and journalism fields to find out some answers, like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What would they use an intranet site for?</li>
        <li>Would they use it before, during, and after the conference?</li> 
        <li>On what device?</li>
        <li>How are they doing research and taking notes?</li>
        <li>Are they having fun or is it stressful?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The responses and insights from the interviews were organized, analyzed, and synthesized into two personas.</p>

      <h6>The Tool of Data-Based Personas</h6>
      <p>With user research, I learned that for journalists a medical conference can make for a challenging day. From synthesizing the interview responses into personas with bios, goals, frustrations, and motiviations, I now had an impactful tool to inform the following user testing:
        <ul>
          <li>A card sort,</li> 
          <li>A heuristic evaluation, and</li>
          <li>The scenario-based usability testing.</li>

      <p>Using evaluation criteria developed by usability professionals, severe problems were noted through 6 individual reviews of the site in the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Homepage,</li>
        <li>Navigation,</li> 
        <li>Content,</li>
        <li>Links, and</li>
        <li>Design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, without a responsive menu bar, the user's navigation through the site would lack structure. Features like breadcrumbs and a simple footer sitemap would be useful for the reporters.</p>
