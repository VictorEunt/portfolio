      <h3>Interviews and Synthesis</h3>
      <h6>Taking Notes at a Medical Conference: It's difficult if you can't find the room.</h6>
      <p>The American Heart Association (AHA) maintains Newsroom, an intranet site for journalists covering the Scientific Sessions, an AHA conference. Quick access to resources is essential.</p> 
      <h4>With late-breaking news releases, media briefings, and tightly scheduled interviews, medical conferences create time constraints for journalists.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 aha-content-center">
      <p>With AHA requesting a review of the site, the 6-member usability team found participants from the medical and journalism fields to find out some answers, like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What would they use an intranet site for?</li>
        <li>Would they use it before, during, and after the conference?</li> 
        <li>On what device?</li>
        <li>How are they doing research and taking notes?</li>
        <li>Are they having fun or is it stressful?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The responses and insights from the interviews were organized, analyzed, and synthesized into two personas.</p>

      <p>With user research, I learned that for journalists a medical conference can make for a challenging day. From synthesizing the interview responses into personas with bios, goals, frustrations, and motivations, I now had an impactful tool to inform the following user testing:
        <ul>
          <li>A card sort,</li>

      <ul>
        <li>The Homepage,</li>
        <li>Navigation,</li> 
        <li>Content,</li>
        <li>Links, and</li>
        <li>Design.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, without a responsive menu bar, the user's navigation through the site would lack structure. Features like breadcrumbs and a simple footer sitemap would be useful for the reporters.</p>

      <h6>Synthesizing the Evaluations</h6>
      <p>With 6 separate evaluations, the most common problems and suggestions were prioritized by the goals and frustrations of the personas. For the journalists, the biggest improvement for the site would come from a reorganization of the content.</p>
      <p>A redesign would improve with images, color, and familiar words: allowing the users to simply identified and scan the content.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The wording of the hyperlinks resulted in confusion,</li>
        <li>The layout of the site seemed "cluttered,"</li> 
        <li>The structure of content was a major factor in the time that a task took to complete, if the task was completed at all, and</li>

      <p>Witnessing the interaction with the Newsroom site and examining the recorded data, the users confirmed and gave insight into the card sort and heuristic evaluation data.
